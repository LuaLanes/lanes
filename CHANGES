CHANGES:

CHANGE 44: BGe 13-Aug-2012
   * lanes code updated to build against Lua 5.1 and Lua 5.2
   * removed the search for MSVCR80.DLL when building for MinGW32 since it no longer seems to be necessary

CHANGE 43: BGe 09-Aug-2012
   * fix possible crash at application shutdown when a race condition causes linda objects to be collected after the keeper states are cleaned up.

CHANGE 42: BGe 06-Aug-2012
   * lanes.linda() accepts an optional name for debug purposes

CHANGE 41: BGe 07-Jul-2012
   * lua51-lanes renamed lanes/core
   * keeper state microcode is no longer embedded inside lanes.core, but located and loaded with package.loaders[2]
   * changed rockspec build type from "make" to "builtin"

CHANGE 40: BGe 26-Jun-2012
   * when a transfered function is not found in source, guess its name to help the user find out what's wrong
   * new function lanes.nameof()

CHANGE 39: BGe 23-Jun-2012
   * lanes.timer() accepts a first_secs=nil to stop a timer
   * timer lane catches errors and prints them
   * fixed some typos in manual

CHANGE 38: BGe 11-Jun-2012
   * linda:receive() batched mode now accepts a max_count optional argument

CHANGE 37: BGe 4-Jun-2012 (fix and idea courtesy of sonoro1234)
   * fixed thread_cancel() not working when called without argument
   * new lane-global function set_error_reporting() to enable more data detailed data provided by lane_error()

CHANGE 36 BGe 26-Apr-2012
   * improved LuaJIT2 compatibility by handling "*" library set through luaL_openlibs()

CHANGE 35 BGe 17-Feb-2012
   * changed lanes.configure signature to receive a table instead of individual parameters
   * added support for an on_state_create callback called to load custom functions in a state in addition to the base libraries

CHANGE 34 BGe 14-Nov-2011
   * removed packagepath and packagecpath options, replaced by a package table, whose fields path, cpath, loaders, preload are transfered
   * code cleanup to facilitate transition between WIN32 and PTHREAD impleentations
   * tentative fix for desinit crashes when free running lanes are killed at process shutdown

CHANGE 33 BGe 5-Nov-2011: Lanes version 3.0-beta
   * process exit change: close everything at GC when main state closes, not when atexit() handlers are processed
   * Lua 5.2-style module:
      * module() is no longer used to implement lanes.lua
      * a global "lanes" variable is no longer created when the module is required
      * the Lanes module table is returned instead
   * Lanes must be initialized before used:
      * the first occurence of 'require "lanes"' produces a minimal interface that only contains a configure() function
      * the remainder of the interface is made available once this function is called
      * subsequent calls to configure() do nothing
      * configure() controls the number of keeper states and the startup of timers
   * LuaJIT 2 compatibility
      * non-Lua functions are no longer copied by creating a C closure from a C pointer, but through 2-way lookup tables
      * this means that if a lane function body pulls non-Lua functions, the lane generator description must contain the list of libraries and modules that exports them
      * introduces a change in configuration .globals management: contents are copied *after* std libs are loaded
      * new .required configuration entry to list modules that must be require()'ed before lane body is transferred
   * lane:cancel() wakes up waiting lindas like what is done at lane shutdown

CHANGE 32 BGe 14-May-2011
   * raise an error when linda:send() has nothing to send

CHANGE 31 BGe 17-Apr-2011
   * linda uses a fast FIFO implementation to speed up data exchanges
   * new linda:count() method
   * new linda batched data read mode
   * proper key type check in all linda methods
   * fix setup-vc.cmd to support Visual Studio 2010 and Windows 7 64 bits
   * bugfix: release keeper state mutex at desinit

CHANGE 30 BGe 30-Mar-2011
   * linda honors __tostring and __concat
   * new accessor linda:keys(), to retrieve the list of keys with pending data inside a linda
   * new lanes options packagepath and packagecpath, in case one needs to set them differently than the default

CHANGE 29 BGe 1-Mar-2011
    fixed potential crash at application shutdown when calling lua_close() on a killed thread's VM.
    exposed cancel_test() in the lanes to enable manual testing for cancellation requests.
    removed kludgy {globals={threadName}} support, replaced with a new function set_debug_threadname().

CHANGE 28 BGe 18-Feb-2011
    - moved keeper-related code in a separate source file
    - keeper.lua is now embedded in text form instead of bytecode to improve LuaJIT2-compatibility

CHANGE 27 BGe 17-Feb-2011
    - we know Lanes is loaded in the master state, so we don't force it
      to be required in every lane too when a linda deep userdata is copied
    - Refactor lane proxy implementation: it is now a full userdata instead
      of a table, and its methods are implemented in C instead of Lua
      * its metatable is no longer accessible
      * writing to the proxy raises an error
      * it is no longer possible to overwrite its join() and cancel() methods
    - when a deep userdata idfunc requests a module to be required, manually
      check that it is not loaded before requiring it instead of relying on
      the require function's loop detection feature
    - when a module must be required, raise an error if the 'require' function
      is not found in the target state

CHANGE 26 BGe 14-Feb-2011:
    Fixed application hang-up because keeper state was not released in case of errors thrown by
    inter-state data copy for unsupported types

CHANGE 25 BGe 12-Feb-2011:
    Changed idfunc signature and contract to clarify that fact it is not lua-callable
    and to be able to require the module it was exported from in the target lanes

CHANGE 24 DPtr 25-Jan-2011:
    Changed lanes.c to export functions as a module rather than writing them directly to the globals table.

CHANGE 23 DPtr 23-Jan-2011:
    Fixed bug where reference to Linda object was dropped for a short time ( crashing if GC was run during that time ).
    Changed the atexit code to trip the timer thread's write signal. 

CHANGE 22 DPtr 19-Jan-2011:
    Changed luaG_push_proxy to cache deep userdata proxies.

CHANGE 21 (bugfixes) BGe 3-Jan-2011:
    Several fixes by Martin Krpan:
    - linda_send was waiting on the wrong signal
    - buildfix when using i586-mingw32msvc-gcc cross compiler
    - lanes_h:cancel() returns a boolean as it should
    - timers could get blocked sometimes because they were initialized with negative values
    - prepare_timeout could generate an illegal setting

CHANGE 20 BGe 3-Dec-2010:
    Enable to specify a string as lane code instead of a function so that we dont use lua_dump, which
    isn't supported by LuaJIT.

CHANGE 19 BGe 2-Dec-2010:
    No longer rely on global function 'tostring' to generate unique identifiers when caching data being transfered through la linda. Should fix a compatilibity issue with LuaJIT2.

CHANGE 18 BGe 6-Oct-2010:
    Fixed 'memory leak' in some situations where a free running lane is collected before application shutdown
	A bit of code cleanup

CHANGE 17 BGe 21-Sept-2010:
    Fixed stupid compilation errors.

CHANGE 16 PLM 24-Aug-2010:
    Releasing memory at gc / atexit.
    Finalizers actually get error strings.
    Fixed missing argument propagation in lane:cancel
    Added variable threadName sent trough globals-table. Set in s_lane, and in debuggers on windows.
    Added argument checking for linda-objects, where missing them caused crashes.

CHANGE 15 (minor) BGe 27-Jul-2010:
    Version bump for a true upgrade release (2.0.4 package was only a renamed 2.0.3)

CHANGE 14 (bug fix) BGe 09-Jul-2010:
    Fixed lane status to be correctly returned as "waiting" when it should.

CHANGE 13 (fix for multithreaded host apps) AKa 24-Jun-2009:
    <borisusun-at-gmail> mentioned Lanes expects the host application to be singlethreaded,
    and there are troubles if Lanes is used from multiple threads, opened by the host
    (before requiring Lanes). This is true, and fix should now be in place.

CHANGE 12 (bug fix on Windows, 2.0.3) AKa 25-Jan-2009:
    Did CHANGE 9 the way it should be done.

CHANGE 11 (new feature, 2.0.3) AKa 23-Jan-2009:
    Finalizers ('set_finalizer()') for being able to do cleanup of a lane's
    resources, whether it returned succesfully or via an error.

CHANGE 10 (new feature, 2.0.3) AKa 23-Jan-2009:
    Call stack showing where an error occurred is not merged with the error
    message, but delivered as a separate stack table ({ "filename:line" [, ...] }).
    Getting call stacks of errorred lanes is now possible.

CHANGE 9 (bug fix on Windows) AKa 10-Dec-2008 (> 2.0.2):
    Applied patch from Kriss Daniels to avoid issues on 'now_time()' in Win32
    (http://luaforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=22704&forum_id=1781).

CHANGE 8 (bug fix) AKa 26-Oct-2008:
    Avoids occasional segfault at process exit (on multicore CPUs). Does this
    by keeping track of "free running" threads (s.a. the time thread) and
    cancelling them at process exit.

    Tested (2.0.2) on Linux 64,x86, OS X, WinXP.

CHANGE 7 (bug fix) AKa 15-Oct-2008:
    Recursive functions that use themselves as direct upvalue can now be
    passed to other lanes, and used as a lane function.

CHANGE 6 (bug fix) AKa 15-Oct-2008:
    Added local caches of the following to src/lanes.lua (was otherwise getting
    errors at least in 'tests/irayo_recursive.lua').

		local assert= assert
		local string_gmatch= assert( string.gmatch )
		local select= assert( select )
		local type= assert( type )
		local pairs= assert( pairs )
		local tostring= assert( tostring )
		local error= assert( error )
		local setmetatable= assert( setmetatable )
		local rawget= assert( rawget )

    Thanks to Irayo for detecting and reporting this.

CHANGE 5 (new feature):
    Modifying Makefile so it's better suited to LuaRocks.

CHANGE 4 (new feature):
    Metatable copying, allowing Lua objects to be copied across lanes.

CHANGE 3 (bug fix) AKa 5-Aug-2008:
    The '__gc' method was not tied to thread userdata, at all. Caused memory
    lifespan problems at least on OS X when threads were cancelled (EINVAL).

CHANGE 2 (bug fix) AKa 5-Aug-2008:
    Better calculation of timeouts, always making them absolute (even in Win32)
    to allow for events that wake the lane up but don't read/write the Linda
    key that it was observing.

CHANGE 1 (bug fix) AKa 4-Aug-2008:
    Signalling woke up only one waiting thread, not all. This caused i.e.
    receive to not wake up if there was another thread waiting on the same
    Linda object.

    PThread fix: using 'pthread_cond_broadcast()' instead of 'pthread_cond_signal()'
    Win32 fix: using manual events and 'PulseEvent()'

(end)
