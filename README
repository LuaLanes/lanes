=====================
  Usage on Windows:
=====================

For once, Win32 thread prioritazion scheme is actually a good one, and
it works. :)  Windows users, feel yourself as VIP citizens!!

-------------------
  Windows / MSYS:
-------------------

On MSYS, 'stderr' output seems to be buffered. You might want to make
it auto-flush, to help you track & debug your scripts. Like this:

    io.stderr:setvbuf "no"

Even after this, MSYS insists on linewise buffering; it will flush at
each newline only.


===================
  Usage on Linux:
===================

Linux NTPL 2.5 (Ubuntu 7.04) was used in the testing of Lua Lanes.

This document (http://www.net.in.tum.de/~gregor/docs/pthread-scheduling.html)
describes fairly well, what (all) is wrong with Linux threading, even today.

For other worthy links:
    http://kerneltrap.org/node/6080
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_POSIX_Thread_Library

In short, you cannot use thread prioritation in Linux. Unless you run as
root, and I _truly_ would not recommend that. Lobby for yet-another thread
implementation for Linux, and mail -> akauppi@gmail.com about it. :)


======================
  Usage on Mac OS X:
======================

No real problems in OS X, _once_ everything is set up right...

In short, have your Lua core compiled with LUA_USE_DLOPEN and LUA_USE_POSIX
instead of the (default as of 5.1) LUA_DL_DYLD and LUA_USE_MACOSX. This is
crucial to have each module loaded only once (even if initialized separately
for each thread) and for the static & global variables within the modules to
actually be process-wide. Lua Lanes cannot live without (and hopefully,
LUA_DL_DYLD is long gone by Lua 5.2)...

Another issue is making sure you only have _one_ Lua core. Your 'lua' binary
must link dynamically to a .dylib, it must _not_ carry a personal copy of Lua
core with itself. If it does, you will gain many mysterious malloc errors
when entering multithreading realm.

<<

rm lua.o luac.o
gcc -dynamiclib -install_name /usr/local/lib/liblua.5.1.dylib \
    -compatibility_version 5.1 -current_version 5.1.2 \
    -o liblua.5.1.2.dylib *.o

gcc -fno-common -DLUA_USE_POSIX -DLUA_USE_DLOPEN -DLUA_USE_READLINE -lreadline -L. -llua.5.1.2 lua.c -o lua

That should be it. :)

Fink 'lua51' packaging has the necessary changes since 5.1.2-3.


=====================
  Usage on FreeBSD:
=====================

Unlike in Linux, also the Lua engine used with Lanes needs to be compiled with
'-lpthread'. Otherwise, the following malloc errors are received:

    <<
    lua in free(): warning: recursive call
    PANIC: unprotected error in call to Lua API (not enough memory)
    <<

Here are the Lua compilation steps that proved to work (FreeBSD 6.2 i386):

    gmake freebsd
    rm lua.o luac.o liblua.a
    gcc -shared -lm -Wl,-E -o liblua.5.1.2.so *.o
    gcc -O2 -Wall -DLUA_USE_LINUX -lm -Wl,-E -lpthread -lreadline -L. -llua.5.1.2 lua.c -o lua

To compile Lanes, use 'gmake' or simply:

    cc -O2 -Wall -llua.5.1.2 -lpthread -shared -o out/bsd-x86/lua51-lanes.so \
        -DGLUA_LUA51 gluax.c lanes.c

To place Lua into ~/local, set the following environment variables (this is
just a reminder for myself...):

    export CPATH=.../local/include
    export LIBRARY_PATH=.../local/lib
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.../local/lib


(end)
