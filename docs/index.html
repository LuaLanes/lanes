<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Lua Lanes is a Lua extension library providing
    the possibility to run multiple Lua states in parallel. It is intended to
    be used for optimizing performance on multicore CPU's and to study ways to make Lua programs naturally parallel to begin with.
</p><p>
    Lanes is included into your software by the regular
    <tt>require "lanes"</tt> method. No C side programming is needed; all APIs are Lua side, and most existing extension modules should
    work seamlessly together with the multiple lanes.
</p><p>
    See <A HREF="comparison.html">comparison</A> of Lua Lanes with other Lua multithreading solutions.
</p><p>
    <h3>Features:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Lanes have separated data, by default. Shared data is possible with Linda objects.
    </li>
    <li>Communications is separate of threads, using Linda objects.
    </li>
    <li>Data passing uses fast inter-state copies (no serialization required)</li>
    </li>
    <li>"Deep userdata" concept, for sharing userdata over multiple lanes
    </li>
    <li>Millisecond level timers, integrated with the Linda system.
    </li>
    <li>Threads can be given priorities -2..+2 (default is 0).
    </li>
    <li>Lanes are cancellable, with proper cleanup.
    </li>
    <li>No application level locking - ever!
    </li>
  </ul>


<h3>Limitations:</h3>

  <ul><li>coroutines are not passed between states
        </li>
      <li>sharing full userdata between states needs special C side
          preparations (-&gt; <A HREF="#deep_userdata">deep userdata</A>)
      </li>
        <li>network level parallelism not included
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>


<!-- systems +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<hr/>
<h2 id="systems">Supported systems</h2>

<p>Lua Lanes supports the following operating systems:

    <ul>
        <li>Mac OS X PowerPC / Intel (10.4 and later)</li>
        <li>Linux x86</li>
        <li>Windows 2000/XP and later <font size="-1">(MinGW or Visual C++ 2005/2008)</font></li>
<!--
    Other OS'es here once people help test them. (and the tester's name)
    
    Win64, BSD, Linux x64, Linux embedded, QNX, Solaris, ...
-->
    </ul>
    
    <p>The underlying threading code can be compiled either towards Win32 API 
    or <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads">Pthreads</a>. Unfortunately, thread prioritation under Pthreads is a JOKE, 
    requiring OS specific tweaks and guessing undocumented behaviour. Other
    features should be portable to any modern platform.
    </p>
</p>


<!-- installing +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<hr/>
<h2 id="installing">Building and Installing</h2>

<p>Lua Lanes is built simply by <tt>make</tt> on the supported platforms
(<tt>make-vc</tt> for Visual C++). See <tt>README</tt> for system specific
details and limitations.
</p>

<p>To install Lanes, all you need are the <tt>lanes.lua</tt> and <tt>lua51-lanes.so|dll</tt>
files to be reachable by Lua (see LUA_PATH, LUA_CPATH). 

Or use <A HREF="http://www.luarocks.org" TARGET="_blank">Lua Rocks</A> package management.
</p>

<pre>
  > luarocks search lanes
    ... output listing Lua Lanes is there ...

  > luarocks install lanes
    ... output ...
</pre>


<!-- launching +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<hr/>
<h2 id="creation">Creation</h2>

<p>The following sample shows preparing a function for parallel calling, and
calling it with varying arguments. Each of the two results is calculated in
a separate OS thread, parallel to the calling one. Reading the results
joins the threads, waiting for any results not already there.
</p>

<table border=1 bgcolor="#FFFFE0" width=500><tr><td>
<pre>
  require "lanes"

  f= lanes.gen( function(n) return 2*n end )
  a= f(1)
  b= f(2)

  print( a[1], b[1] )     -- 2    4
</pre>
</table>

<p>
<table border=1 bgcolor="#E0E0FF" cellpadding=10><tr><td>
    <code>func= lanes.gen( [libs_str | opt_tbl [, ...],] lane_func )
    <br/><br/>
    lane_h= func( ... )</code>
</table>
</p>
</p><p>
    The function returned by <tt>lanes.gen()</tt> is a "generator" for
    launching any number of lanes. They will share code, options, initial globals,
    but the particular arguments may vary. Only calling the generator function
    actually launches a lane, and provides a handle for controlling it.
    Alternatively, <tt>lane_func</tt> may be a string, in which case it will be compiled
    in the lane. This is to be able to launch lanes whith LuaJIT,
    which does not support lua_dump, used internally to transfer functions to the lane.
<!--
</p>
<p>This prepares <tt>lane_func</tt> to be called in parallel. It does not yet start
anything, but merely returns a <i>generator function</i> that can be called
any number of times, with varying parameters. Each call will spawn a new lane.
-->
</p><p>
Lanes automatically copies upvalues over to the new lanes, so you
need not wrap all the required elements into one 'wrapper' function. If
<tt>lane_func</tt> uses some local values, or local functions, they will be there
also in the new lanes.
</p><p>
    <code>libs_str</code> defines the standard libraries made available to the
    new Lua state:
    <table>
        <tr><td/><td>(nothing)</td><td>no standard libraries (default)</td></tr>
        <tr><td width=40><td><tt>"base"</tt> or <tt>""</tt></td>
            <td>root level names, <tt>print</tt>, <tt>assert</tt>, <tt>unpack</tt> etc.</td></tr>
        <tr><td/><td><tt>"coroutine"</tt></td><td><tt>coroutine.*</tt> namespace <font size="-1">(part of base in Lua 5.1)</font></td></tr>
        <tr><td/><td><tt>"debug"</tt></td><td><tt>debug.*</tt> namespace</td></tr>
        <tr><td/><td><tt>"io"</tt></td><td><tt>io.*</tt> namespace</td></tr>
        <tr><td/><td><tt>"math"</tt></td><td><tt>math.*</tt> namespace</td></tr>
        <tr><td/><td><tt>"os"</tt></td><td><tt>os.*</tt> namespace</td></tr>
        <tr><td/><td><tt>"package"</tt></td><td><tt>package.*</tt> namespace and <tt>require</tt></td></tr>
        <tr><td/><td><tt>"string"</tt></td><td><tt>string.*</tt> namespace</td></tr>
        <tr><td/><td><tt>"table"</tt></td><td><tt>table.*</tt> namespace</td></tr>
        <br/>
        <tr><td/><td><tt>"*"</tt></td><td>all standard libraries</td></tr>
    </table>

</p><p>
    Initializing the standard libs takes a bit of time at each lane invocation.
    This is the main reason why "no libraries" is the default.
</p><p>

    <code>opt_tbl</code> is a collection of named options to control the way
    lanes are run:
</p><p>
  <table>
    <tr valign=top><td/><td>
        <code>.cancelstep</code> <br/><nobr>N / true</nobr></td>
    <td>
    By default, lanes are only cancellable when they <u>enter</u> a pending
    <tt>:receive()</tt> or <tt>:send()</tt> call.
    With this option, one can set cancellation check to occur every <tt>N</tt>
    Lua statements. The value <tt>true</tt> uses a default value (100).
    </td></tr>

    <tr valign=top><td/><td>
        <code>.globals</code> <br/>globals_tbl</td>
    <td>
    Sets the globals table for the launched threads. This can be used for giving
    them constants.
    </p><p>
    The global values of different lanes are in no manner connected;
    modifying one will only affect the particular lane. Settings the variable 'threadName' in this table makes VS display the sent name instead of the normal thread name while debugging.
    </td></tr>

    <tr valign=top><td width=40><td>
        <code>.priority</code> <br/><nobr>-2..+2</nobr></td>
        <td>The priority of lanes generated. -2 is lowest, +2 is highest.
        <p>
    Implementation and dependability of priorities varies
    by platform. Especially Linux kernel 2.6 is not supporting priorities in user mode.
    </td></tr>
  </table>
  
</p>

<h3>Free running lanes</h3>

<p>
The lane handles are allowed to be 'let loose'; in other words you may execute
a lane simply by:

<pre>
    lanes.gen( function() ... end ) ()
</pre>

Normally, this kind of lanes will be in an eternal loop handling messages.
Since the lane handle is gone,
there is no way to control such a lane from the outside, nor read its potential
return values. Then again, such a lane does not even normally return.
</p>


<!-- status +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<hr/>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>

<table border=1 bgcolor="#E0E0FF" cellpadding=10><tr><td>
    <code>str= lane_h.status</code>
</table>

<p>The current execution state of a lane can be read via its <tt>status</tt>
member, providing one of these values: <sup>(<a href="#2">2</a></sup>

    <table>
        <tr><td width=40><td><tt>"pending"</tt></td><td>not started, yet</td></tr>
        <tr><td/><td><tt>"running"</tt></td><td>running</td></tr>
        <tr><td/><td><tt>"waiting"</tt></td><td>waiting at a Linda <tt>:receive()</tt> or <tt>:send()</tt></td></tr>
        <tr><td/><td><tt>"done"</tt></td><td>finished executing (results are ready)</td></tr>
        <tr><td/><td><tt>"error"</tt></td><td>met an error (reading results will propagate it)</td></tr>
        <tr><td/><td><tt>"cancelled"</tt></td><td>received cancellation and finished itself</td></tr>
    </table>
</p><p>
    This is similar to <tt>coroutine.status</tt>, which has: <tt>"running"</tt> /
    <tt>"suspended"</tt> / <tt>"normal"</tt> / <tt>"dead"</tt>. Not using the
    exact same names is intentional.
</p>


<!-- results +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<hr/>
<h2 id="results">Results and errors</h2>

<p>A lane can be waited upon by simply reading its results. This can be done
in two ways.
</p><p>

<table border=1 bgcolor="#E0E0FF" cellpadding=10><tr><td>
    <code>[val]= lane_h[1]</code>
</table>
<p>
Makes sure lane has finished, and gives its first (maybe only) return value.
Other return values will be available in other <tt>lane_h</tt> indices.
</p><p>
If the lane ended in an error, it is propagated to master state at this place.
</p>

<table border=1 bgcolor="#E0E0FF" cellpadding=10><tr><td>
    <code>[...]|[nil,err,stack_tbl]= lane_h:join( [timeout_secs] )</code>
</table>
<p>
Waits until the lane finishes, or <tt>timeout</tt> seconds have passed.
Returns <tt>nil</tt> on timeout, <tt>nil,err,stack_tbl</tt> if the lane hit an error,
or the return values of the lane. Unlike in reading the results in table
fashion, errors are not propagated.
</p><p>
<tt>stack_tbl</tt> is an array of "&lt;filename&gt;:&lt;line&gt;" strings,
describing where the error was thrown. Use <tt>table.concat()</tt> to format
it to your liking (or just ignore it).
</p><p>
If you use <tt>:join</tt>, make sure your lane main function returns
a non-nil value so you can tell timeout and error cases apart from succesful
return (using the <tt>.status</tt> property may be risky, since it might change
between a timed out join and the moment you read it).
</p><p>

<table border=1 bgcolor="#FFFFE0" width=500><tr><td>
<pre>
  require "lanes"

  f= lanes.gen( function() error "!!!" end )
  a= f(1)

  --print( a[1] )   -- propagates error

  v,err= a:join()   -- no propagation
  if v==nil then
    error( "'a' faced error"..tostring(err) )   -- manual propagation
  end
</pre>
</table>

<p>
If you want to wait for multiple lanes to finish (any of a set of lanes), use
a <a href="#lindas">Linda</a> object. Give each lane a specific id, and send
that id over a Linda once that thread is done (as the last thing you do).
</p>


<!-- cancelling +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<hr/>
<h2 id="cancelling">Cancelling</h2>

<table border=1 bgcolor="#E0E0FF" cellpadding=10><tr><td>
    <code>bool= lane_h:cancel( [timeout_secs=0.0,] [force_kill_bool=false] )</code>
</table>

<p>Sends a cancellation request to the lane. If <tt>timeout_secs</tt> is non-zero, waits
for the request to be processed, or a timeout to occur.
Returns <tt>true</tt> if the lane was already done (in <tt>"done"</tt>, <tt>"error"</tt> or <tt>"cancelled"</tt> status)
or if the cancellation was fruitful within timeout period.
</p><p>
If the lane is still running and <tt>force_kill</tt> is <tt>true</tt>, the 
OS thread running the lane is forcefully killed. This means no GC, and should
generally be the last resort.
</p>
<p>Cancellation is tested <u>before</u> going to sleep in <tt>receive()</tt> or <tt>send()</tt> calls
and after executing <tt>cancelstep</tt> Lua statements. A currently pending <tt>receive</tt>
or <tt>send</tt> call is currently not awakened, and may be a reason for a non-detected cancel.
</p>


<!-- finalizers +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<hr/>
<h2 id="finalizers">Finalizers</h2>

<table border=1 bgcolor="#E0E0FF" cellpadding=10><tr><td>
    <code>set_finalizer( finalizer_func )</code>
    <br/><br/>
    <code>void= finalizer_func( [error] )</code>
</table>

<p>The <tt>error</tt> call is used for throwing exceptions in Lua. What Lua
does not offer, however, is scoped <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finalizer">finalizers</a> 
that would get called when a certain block of instructions gets exited, whether
through peaceful return or abrupt <tt>error</tt>.
</p>
<p>Since 2.0.3, Lanes prepares a function <tt>set_finalizer</tt> for doing this. 
Any functions given to it will be called in the lane Lua state, just prior to 
closing it. They are not called in any particular order.
</p>
<p>An error in a finalizer itself overrides the state of the regular chunk
(in practise, it would be highly preferable <i>not</i> to have errors in finalizers). 
If one finalizer errors, the others may not get called.
</p>


<!-- lindas +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<hr/>
<h2 id="lindas">Lindas</h2>

<p>Communications between lanes is completely detached from the lane handles
themselves. By itself, a lane can only provide return values once it's finished,
or throw an error. Needs to communicate during runtime are handled by <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_%28coordination_language%29" TARGET="_blank">Linda objects</A>, which are 
<A HREF="#deep_userdata">deep userdata</A> instances. They can be provided to a lane
as startup parameters, upvalues or in some other Linda's message.
</p><p>
Access to a Linda object means a lane can read or write to any of its data
slots. Multiple lanes can be accessing the same Linda in parallel. No application
level locking is required; each Linda operation is atomic.
</p><p>

<table border=1 bgcolor="#FFFFE0" width=500><tr><td>
<pre>
  require "lanes"

  local linda= lanes.linda()

  local function loop( max )
    for i=1,max do
        print( "sending: "..i )
        linda:send( "x", i )    -- linda as upvalue
    end
  end
  
  a= lanes.gen("",loop)( 10000 )

  while true do
    local val= linda:receive( 3.0, "x" )    -- timeout in seconds&nbsp;
    if val==nil then
        print( "timed out" )
        break
    end
    print( "received: "..val )
  end
</pre>
</table>

</p>
<p>Characteristics of the Lanes implementation of Lindas are:

<ul>
    <li>keys can be of number, string or boolean type
    </li>
    <li>values can be any type supported by inter-state copying (same limits
    as for function parameters and upvalues)
    </li>
    <li>consuming method is <tt>:receive</tt> (not in)
    </li>
    <li>non-consuming method is <tt>:get</tt> (not rd)
    </li>
    <li>two producer-side methods: <tt>:send</tt> and <tt>:set</tt> (not out)
    </li>
    <li><tt>send</tt> allows for sending multiple values -atomically- to a
    given key
    </li>
    <li><tt>receive</tt> can wait for multiple keys at once
    </li>
    <li>individual keys' queue length can be limited, balancing speed differences
    in a producer/consumer scenario (making <tt>:send</tt> wait)
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<table border=1 bgcolor="#E0E0FF" cellpadding=10><tr><td>
    <code>h= lanes.linda()</code>
    <br/><br/>
    <code>bool= h:send( [timeout_secs,] key, ... )</code>
    <br/>
    <code>[val, key]= h:receive( [timeout_secs,] key [, ...] )</code>
    <br/><br/>
    <code>= h:limit( key, n_uint )</code>
</table>

<p>The <tt>send</tt> and <tt>receive</tt> methods use Linda keys as FIFO stacks
(first in, first out). Timeouts are given in seconds (millisecond accuracy).
If using numbers as the first Linda key, one must explicitly give <tt>nil</tt>
as the timeout parameter to avoid ambiguities.
</p><p>
By default, stack sizes are unlimited but limits can be
enforced using the <tt>limit</tt> method. This can be useful to balance execution
speeds in a producer/consumer scenario.
</p><p>
Note that any number of lanes can be reading or writing a Linda. There can be
many producers, and many consumers. It's up to you.
</p>
<p><tt>send</tt> returns <tt>true</tt> if the sending succeeded, and <tt>false</tt>
if the queue limit was met, and the queue did not empty enough during the given
timeout.
</p><p>
Equally, <tt>receive</tt> returns a value and the key that provided the value, 
or nothing for timeout. Note that <tt>nil</tt>s can be sent and received;
the <tt>key</tt> value will tell it apart from a timeout.
</p><p>
Multiple values can be sent to a given key at once, atomically (the send will
fail unless all the values fit within the queue limit). This can be useful for
multiple producer scenarios, if the protocols used are giving data in streams
of multiple units. Atomicity avoids the producers from garbling each others
messages, which could happen if the units were sent individually.
</p><p>

When receiving from multiple slots, the keys are checked in order, which can
be used for making priority queues.
</p><p>

<table border=1 bgcolor="#E0E0FF" cellpadding=10><tr><td>
    <code>linda_h:set( key, [val] )</code>
    <br/>
    <code>[val]= linda_h:get( key )</code>
</table>

</p><p>
The table access methods are for accessing a slot without queuing or consuming.
They can be used for making shared tables of storage among the lanes.
</p><p>
Writing to a slot overwrites existing value, and clears any possible queued 
entries. Table access and <tt>send</tt>/<tt>receive</tt> can be used together; 
reading a slot essentially peeks the next outcoming value of a queue.
</p>

<!--
<p>
<table border=1 bgcolor="#E0E0FF" cellpadding=10><tr><td>
    <code>lightuserdata= linda_h:deep()</code>
</table>

<p>There is one more method that is not required in applications, but
discussing it is good for a preview of how deep userdata works.
</p><p>
Because proxy objects (<tt>linda_h</tt>) are just pointers to the real, deep
userdata, they cannot be used to identify a certain Linda from the others.
The internal timer system needs to do this, and the <tt>:deep()</tt> method
has been added for its use. It returns a light userdata pointing to the 
<i>actual</i> deep object, and thus can be used for seeing, which proxies actually
mean the same underlying object. You might or might not need a similar system
with your own deep userdata.
</p>
-->


<h3>Granularity of using Lindas</h3>

<p>A single Linda object provides an infinite number of slots, so why would
you want to use several?
</p><p>There are some important reasons:

<ul>
    <li>Access control. If you don't trust certain code completely, or just
    to modularize your design, use one Linda for one usage and another one
    for the other. This keeps your code clear and readable. You can pass
    multiple Linda handles to a lane with practically no added cost.
    </li>
    
    <li>Namespace control. Linda keys have a "flat" namespace, so collisions
    are possible if you try to use the same Linda for too many separate uses.
    </li>
    
    <li>Performance. Changing any slot in a Linda causes all pending threads
    for that Linda to be momentarily awakened (at least in the C level). 
    This can degrade performance due to unnecessary OS level context switches.
    </li>
</ul>

On the other side, you need to use a common Linda for waiting for multiple
keys. You cannot wait for keys from two separate Linda objects at the same
time.
</p><p>
<font size="-1">Actually, you can. Make separate lanes to wait each, and then multiplex those
events to a common Linda, but... :).</font>
</p>


<!-- timers +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

<h2 id="timers">Timers</h2>

<table border=1 bgcolor="#E0E0FF" cellpadding=10><tr><td>
    <code>= lanes.timer( linda_h, key, date_tbl|first_secs [,period_secs] )</code>
</table>

<p>
Timers can be run once, or in a reoccurring fashion (<tt>period_secs > 0</tt>). 
The first occurrence can be given either as a date or as a relative delay in seconds. 
The <tt>date</tt> table is like what <tt>os.date("*t")</tt> returns, in the 
local time zone.
</p><p>
Once a timer expires, the <tt>key</tt> is set with the current time
(in seconds, same offset as <tt>os.time()</tt> but with millisecond accuracy). 
The key can be waited upon using the regular Linda <tt>:receive()</tt>
method.
</p><p>
A timer can be stopped simply by <tt>first_secs=0</tt> and no period.

Having the API as <tt>lanes.timer()</tt> is intentional. Another
alternative would be <tt>linda_h:timer()</tt> but timers are not traditionally
seen to be part of Lindas. Also, it would mean any lane getting a Linda handle
would be able to modify timers on it. A third choice could
be abstracting the timers out of Linda realm altogether (<tt>timer_h= lanes.timer( date|first_secs, period_secs )</tt>)
but that would mean separate waiting functions for timers, and lindas. Even if
a linda object and key was returned, that key couldn't be waited upon simultaneously
with one's general linda events.
The current system gives maximum capabilities with minimum API, and any smoothenings
can easily be crafted in Lua at the application level.

<!-- locks +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<hr/>
<h2 id="locks">Locks etc.</h2>

<p>
Lanes does not generally require locks or critical sections to be used, at all.
If necessary, a limited queue can be used to emulate them. <tt>lanes.lua</tt>
offers some sugar to make it easy:
</p><p>

<table border=1 bgcolor="#E0E0FF" cellpadding=10><tr><td><pre>
  lock_func= lanes.genlock( linda_h, key [,N_uint=1] )

  lock_func( M_uint )     -- acquire
    ..
  lock_func( -M_uint )    -- release
</table>
</p><p>

The generated function acquires M entries from the N available, or releases
them if the value is negative. The acquiring call will suspend the lane, if necessary.
Use <tt>M=N=1</tt> for a critical section lock (only one lane allowed to enter).
</p><p>

Note: The locks generated are <u>not recursive</u>. That would need another
kind of generator, which is currently not implemented.
</p><p>

Similar sugar exists for atomic counters:
</p><p>

<table border=1 bgcolor="#E0E0FF" cellpadding=10><tr><td><pre>
  atomic_func= lanes.genatomic( linda_h, key [,initial_num=0.0] )

  new_num= atomic_func( [diff_num=+1.0] )
</table>
</p><p>

Each time called, the generated function will change <tt>linda[key]</tt> 
atomically, without other lanes being able to interfere. The new value is
returned. You can use either <tt>diff 0.0</tt> or <tt>get</tt> to just read the current
value.
</p><p>

Note that the generated functions can be passed on to other lanes.
</p>

<!-- C modules +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<hr/>
<h2 id="c_modules">C Modules</h2>
<p>
Most Lua extension modules should work unaltered with Lanes.
If the module simply ties C side features to Lua, everything is fine without
alterations. The <tt>luaopen_...()</tt> entry point will be called separately for each
lane, where the module is <tt>require</tt>'d from.
</p><p>
If it, however, also does one-time C side initializations, these
should be covered into a one-time-only construct such as below.
</p><p>

<table><tr><td width=40>
    <td bgcolor="#ffffe0">
<pre>
 int luaopen_module( lua_State *L )
 {
    static char been_here;  /* 0 by ANSI C */
    
    /* Calls to 'require' serialized by Lanes; this is safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    */
    if (!been_here) {
        been_here= 1;
        ... one time initializations ...
    }
    
    ... binding to Lua ...
 }
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<h3 id="c_functions">Passing C functions between lanes</h3>

<p>C functions depending on the module to be initialized before the function is called will require special handling to make sure that the module is already initialized in the target Lane before the function is passed to it. This can be done by always requiring the appropriate module in each Lane before passing functions, or by using the <tt>register_function</tt> function to tell Lanes to automatically load the required module when passing a function to another Lane that doesn't already have the module loaded.
</p>
<p>
C functions can be individually registered with <tt>register_function</tt> as they are needed. Or when you require a module, you can give the whole module table to <tt>register_function</tt> and it will register all C functions recursively found in keys and values of that table. This should register all C functions for most modules, but will not be able to access functions in metatables or C functions created by the module after initialization. These functions must be individually registered as needed.
</p>
<p>
<tt>get_function_module</tt> returns the name of the module that the function was registered with, but it can be used to check if a function is registered or not, as it returns <tt>nil</tt> for unregistered functions.
</p>
<table border=1 bgcolor="#E0E0FF" cellpadding=10><tr><td><pre>
  void= lanes.register_function(module_name, function|table, [...])
	
  string= lanes.get_function_module(function)
</table>

<h3 id="shared_userdata">Deep userdata in your own apps</h3>

<p>
The mechanism Lanes uses for sharing Linda handles between separate Lua states
can be used for custom userdata as well. Here's what to do.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Provide an <i>identity function</i> for your userdata, in C. This function is
used for creation and deletion of your deep userdata (the shared resource),
and for making metatables for the state-specific proxies for accessing it.
Take a look at <tt>linda_id</tt> in <tt>lanes.c</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>Create your userdata using <tt>luaG_deep_userdata()</tt>, which is
    a Lua-callable function. Given an <tt>idfunc</tt>, it sets up the support
    structures and returns a state-specific proxy userdata for accessing your
    data. This proxy can also be copied over to other lanes.
    </li>
    <li>Accessing the deep userdata from your C code, use <tt>luaG_todeep()</tt>
    instead of the regular <tt>lua_touserdata()</tt>.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Deep userdata management will take care of tying to <tt>__gc</tt> methods,
and doing reference counting to see how many proxies are still there for 
accessing the data. Once there are none, the data will be freed through a call
to the <tt>idfunc</tt> you provided.
</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: The lifespan of deep userdata may exceed that of the Lua state
that created it. The allocation of the data storage should not be tied to
the Lua state used. In other words, use <tt>malloc</tt>/<tt>free</tt> or
similar memory handling mechanism.
</p>

<h3>Limitations on data passing</h3>

<p>Data passed between lanes (either as starting parameters, return values, upvalues or via Lindas) must conform to the following:
</p>
<p><ul>
	<li>Booleans, numbers, strings, light userdata, Lua functions and tables of such can always be passed.
	</li>
	<li>Cyclic tables and/or duplicate references are allowed and reproduced appropriately, 
	but only <u>within the same transmission</u>.
	   <ul>
	       <li>using the same source table in multiple Linda messages keeps no ties between the tables
	       </li>
	   </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Objects (tables with a metatable) are copyable between lanes.
        <ul>
            <li>metatables are assumed to be immutable; they are internally indexed and only copied once
            per each type of objects per lane
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>C functions (<tt>lua_CFunction</tt>) referring to <tt>LUA_ENVIRONINDEX</tt> or <tt>LUA_REGISTRYINDEX</tt> might not
    work right in the target
        <ul>
            <li><tt><a href="#c_functions">register_function()<a/></tt> can be used to automatically initialize modules when a registered function is transferred. Or you can just make sure that all lanes in question have the appropriate modules initialized before passing C functions.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Full userdata can be passed only if it's prepared using the <A HREF="#shared_userdata">deep userdata</A>
        system, which handles its lifespan management
        <ul>
            <li>in particular, lane handles cannot be passed between lanes
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>coroutines cannot be passed
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Lane handles don't travel</h3>

<p>
Lane handles are not implemented as deep userdata, and cannot thus be
copied across lanes. This is intentional; problems would occur at least when
multiple lanes were to wait upon one to get ready. Also, it is a matter of
design simplicity.
</p><p>
The same benefits can be achieved by having a single worker lane spawn all
the sublanes, and keep track of them. Communications to and from this lane
can be handled via a Linda.
</p>


<h3>Beware with print and file output</h3>

<p>
In multithreaded scenarios, giving multiple parameters to <tt>print()</tt>
or <tt>file:write()</tt> may cause them to be overlapped in the output,
something like this:

<pre>
  A:  print( 1, 2, 3, 4 )
  B:  print( 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' )
  
  1   a   b   2   3   c   d   4
</pre>

Lanes does not protect you from this behaviour. The thing to do is either to
concentrate your output to a certain lane per stream, or to concatenate output
into a single string before you call the output function.
</p>


<h3 id="performance">Performance considerations</h3>

<p>
Lanes is about making multithreading easy, and natural in the Lua state of mind.
Expect performance not to be an issue, if your program is logically built.
Here are some things one should consider, if best performance is vital:
</p><p>
<ul>
    <li>Data passing (parameters, upvalues, Linda messages) is generally fast,
    doing two binary state-to-state copies (from source state to hidden state,
    hidden state to target state). Remember that not only the function you 
    specify but also its upvalues, their upvalues, etc. etc. will get copied.
    </li>
    <li>Lane startup is fast (1000's of lanes a second), depending on the
    number of standard libraries initialized. Initializing all standard libraries
    is about 3-4 times slower than having no standard libraries at all. If you
    throw in a lot of lanes per second, make sure you give them minimal necessary
    set of libraries.
    </li>
    <li>Waiting Lindas are woken up (and execute some hidden Lua code) each
    time <u>any</u> key in the Lindas they are waiting for are changed. This
    may give essential slow-down (not measured, just a gut feeling) if a lot
    of Linda keys are used. Using separate Linda objects for logically separate
    issues will help (which is good practise anyhow).
    </li>
    <li>Linda objects are light. The memory footprint is two OS-level signalling
    objects (<tt>HANDLE</tt> or <tt>pthread_cond_t</tt>) for each, plus one
    C pointer for the proxies per each Lua state using the Linda. Barely nothing.
    </li>
    <li>Timers are light. You can probably expect timers up to 0.01 second
    resolution to be useful, but that is very system specific. All timers are
    merged into one main timer state (see <tt>timer.lua</tt>); no OS side
    timers are utilized.
    </li>
    <li>Lindas are hashed to a fixed number of "keeper states", which are a locking entity. 
    If you are using a lot of Linda objects,
    it may be useful to try having more of these keeper states. By default,
    only one is used (see <tt>KEEPER_STATES_N</tt>), but this is an implementation detail.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3 id="cancelling_cancel">Cancelling cancel</h3>

<p>
Cancellation of lanes uses the Lua error mechanism with a special lightuserdata
error sentinel. 
If you use <tt>pcall</tt> in code that needs to be cancellable
from the outside, the special error might not get through to Lanes, thus
preventing the Lane from being cleanly cancelled. You should throw any
lightuserdata error further.
</p><p>
This system can actually be used by application to detect cancel, do your own
cancellation duties, and pass on the error so Lanes will get it. If it does
not get a clean cancellation from a lane in due time,
it may forcefully kill the lane.
</p><p>
The sentinel is exposed as <tt>lanes.cancel_error</tt>, if you wish to use
its actual value.
